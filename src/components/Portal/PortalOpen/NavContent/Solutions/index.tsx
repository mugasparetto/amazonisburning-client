      <h2>Possible solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Here, we present a sneak peek on how to fight the Amazon’s
        deforestation:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Designation of public forests:</strong> the non-designated
          public forests are the ones mainly affected by deforestation, as they
          are awaiting a status of either ‘land to be conserved’ or ‘land to be
          sustainably used’, encouraging illegal possession of the land and its
          uncontrolled deforestation. There is a lack of oversight in these
          regions and designating the public forests as a conservational unit,
          indigenous land, or any other category would ensure their appropriate
          usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conservation incentives for private areas:</strong> measures
          such as economic incentives and tax redistribution could be taken to
          guarantee that some private areas are conserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increase agricultural productivity:</strong> the lack of
          productivity in livestock generates a feeling that the farmers need
          more land to accomplish production goals, creating the need for more
          deforestation when this could be addressed by simple techniques like
          pasture rotation and crop-livestock-forest integration. Avoiding
          monoculture would also be interesting, as this practice decreases
          biodiversity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strengthening environmental control:</strong> Creating laws
          and incentives to protect the forest and supervising their
          implementation could potentially help the Amazon get back on track.
          This has been done before and proved to be economically efficient and
          ecologically adequate, but subsequent budget cuts undermined their
          efficacy.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </>
