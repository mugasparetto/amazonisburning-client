        <p>
          Amazon fires are worsened by feedback loops involving deforestation,
          land use, and climate change. El Ni√±o-driven droughts dry the forest,
          while leaf litter increases flammability. Reduced vegetation lowers
          rainfall, and smoke from slash-and-burn agriculture further suppresses
          rain. These factors make fires spread more easily, perpetuating a
          cycle of forest loss and intensified drought.
